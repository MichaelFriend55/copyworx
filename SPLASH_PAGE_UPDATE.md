```

**Steps:**
1. Save the logo image (the one with the computer monitor and "CopyWorx™ STUDIO" text)
2. Name it exactly: `copyworx-studio-logo.png`
3. Place it in the `/public/` directory of your project

The file path should be:
```
copyworx-v4/
  └── public/
      └── copyworx-studio-logo.png  ← Save your logo here
```
