## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Be Specific
Bad: "Young people who like tech"
Good: "Age 25-34, Software engineers, $80K-$120K salary"

### 2. Include Real Phrases
Listen to your customers' actual words:
- "I don't have time for..."
- "I wish there was a way to..."
- "My biggest challenge is..."

### 3. Use Photos
Real or representative photos make personas feel more real
- Stock photos work fine
- Company headshots if available
- Illustrated avatars okay too

### 4. Update Regularly
Personas evolve as you learn more:
- Add new pain points you discover
- Update goals based on trends
- Refine language patterns

### 5. Create Multiple Personas
Different audiences = different personas:
- Primary persona (80% of audience)
- Secondary personas (20%)
- Negative persona (who you DON'T target)
